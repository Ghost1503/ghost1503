Hey, I’m Ghost! I’m a guy who’s been coding for a bit and loves messing with APIs—taking them apart and building my own. I like putting together stuff that works, like website backends or tricks to skip the boring stuff.

### What I Do
- Work with APIs—breaking them down and creating my own
- Build the core systems for apps and websites
  
### My Projects
- **[RazorBoost](https://razorboost.in/)** - My spot for e-commerce hacks and Discord tools. I throw together code and shortcuts there.
- **[RazorCap](https://razorcap.xyz/)** - A thing to dodge captchas like hCaptcha and Cloudflare.

### Where I Hang
- **[Nightspot Discord](https://discord.gg/nightspot)** - Chill group.
- **[Delhites Discord](https://discord.gg/delhites)** - Delhi vibes.

Tech spots:
- **[Razor Boost](https://discord.gg/razor-boost)** - Chat about RazorBoost.
- **[Razor Cap](https://discord.gg/razor-cap)** - Captcha talk.

### Hit Me Up
Wanna talk code or whatever? I’m on Discord as **[Ghost](https://discord.com/users/922631391806652467)**. For bigger stuff, reach me through RazorBoost or RazorCap. I’m easygoing and up for a chat!
